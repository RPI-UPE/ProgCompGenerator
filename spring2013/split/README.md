You are given a sequence of `n` numbers. Your goal is to split up these numbers
into as many groups as possible such that the sum of the numbers in each group
is equal across all groups. A group can only consist of numbers that are
sequential with each other.

Your input will be first an integer telling you how many numbers to read, and
then a new number on each line. Your output will be a single integer
representing how many groups of equal sum were formed.

Example input

```
2

1

Example output
